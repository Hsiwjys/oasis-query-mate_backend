OASIS data. It includes both general data collection conventions and item-specific guidance, as well as links to resources for agencies. 1.2 Organization of the Manual This manual includes the following content: \u2022 Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction to the OASIS Manual, including the manual purpose, structure and content, and description of the OASIS requirements and conventions. The manual summarizes the statutory authority for OASIS data collection, and describes the background on the development of OASIS, and its version history. \u2022 Chapter 2 \u2013 The importance of Data Accuracy, and how HHAs may audit OASIS data to minimize errors.

OASIS is not intended to represent a comprehensive assessment in and of itself. HHAs are expected to incorporate OASIS items into their comprehensive assessment documentation and follow their own assessment policies and procedures. Agencies may rearrange OASIS item sequence in a way that permits logical ordering within their own forms and electronic records, if the actual item content, and OASIS number and formatting remain the same, and maintaining the same skip logic. The comprehensive assessment forms the basis of the physician-ordered Plan of Care. Thus, there should be congruence between the overall comprehensive assessment and the Plan of Care. Agencies may have the comprehensive assessment including OASIS, if applicable, completed by one clinician. If collaboration with other health care personnel and/or agency staff is utilized, the agency is responsible for establishing policies and practices related to collaborative efforts, including how assessment information from multiple clinicians will be documented within the clinical record, ensuring compliance with applicable requirements, and accepted standards of practice. 1.5.3 When is OASIS Completed?", "page_num": 11, "metadata": {"chunk_id": 0, "prev_chunk_id": null, "next_chunk_id": 1}}, {"text": "1.5.3 When is OASIS Completed?

The uses for OASIS data have continued to evolve over the years with significant quality and payment implications tied to OASIS data. The current uses for OASIS include: 1) Home Health Agency Medicare-certification surveys, 2) the quality measures on the consumer-focused Care Compare website, 3) the quality measures used in the Home Health Quality of Patient Care Star Ratings, 4) the quality measures used in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Home Health Value- Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model, and 5) the Quality Assessment Only (QAO) Metric used in home health pay-for- reporting (P4R).

HISTORY OF OASIS AND OUTCOME-BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (OBQI) In the early 2000s, CMS promoted a quality improvement process for home health called Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI). OBQI used OASIS-based quality measures as the foundation for home health quality improvement activities. CMS, through their contracts with state Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), provided training to home health agencies nationally on OBQI. Agency training and the use of OBQI to improve quality was a preparatory step for the home health public reporting of quality measures. In 2002, CMS announced plans for public reporting of home health quality measures. In the fall of 2003, CMS launched the Home Health Compare website. This initiative encouraged consumers to use publicly available home health quality measures when selecting a home health agency. The launch of Home Health Compare was also a catalyst for agency quality improvement activities as well as the marketing and promotion of quality of care by individual agencies. The OASIS-based measures created the foundation for these early activities and advances in home health quality improvement.", "page_num": 278, "metadata": {"chunk_id": 1, "prev_chunk_id": 0, "next_chunk_id": 2}}, {"text": "The launch of Home Health Compare was also a catalyst for agency quality improvement activities as well as the marketing and promotion of quality of care by individual agencies.

In 2021, CMS retired the Home Health Compare website and launched the Care Compare website (https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare). With Care Compare, CMS merged multiple setting-specific Compare sites into one consumer-friendly site that features information from providers across the continuum. At the time of the launch of Care Compare, CMS also launched another website related to publicly reported data: the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data). While Care Compare is a consumer-focused tool, PDC is a resource geared toward providers, vendors, and researchers. The PDC website includes downloadable data from the Care Compare site as well as additional measure-specific information. UNDERSTANDING QUALITY & QUALITY IMPROVEMENT What is quality?

However, standard definitions are required to be able to measure quality and to then improve quality. The OASIS-based quality measures provide the home health industry with a framework for defining quality in terms of what matters to a patient and their caregivers. The home health quality measures have included many measures of activities of daily living (ADLs), patient status, and home health agency care processes. These include the measures of \u201cImprovement in Ambulation- Locomotion\u201d, \u201cStabilization in Grooming,\u201d \u201cImprovement in Bed Transferring,\u201d etc. These measures are important to patients as they symbolize quality of life and independence in a home setting.

Through the internet Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES) reports, agencies can compare, or benchmark, their current performance to their prior performance on each quality measure and compare their performance to a national reference rate. OUTCOME AND PROCESS MEASURES The initial OASIS-based quality measures were risk adjusted outcome measures. Shortly after the 2010 implementation of OASIS-C, agencies were introduced to the first standardized process measures which were derived from OASIS data. OUTCOME MEASURES An outcome is a health status change that occurs over time, where the change is intrinsic to the patient and change can be positive (improvement), negative (worsening) or neutral (no change).

The definition of an outcome does not include a presumed direction; therefore, any deviation (or non-deviation) in health status between the initial time point and the follow-up time point constitutes an outcome. For example, did the patient\u2019s ability to walk and move around improve by the time they finished working with the home health agency? A rate of 88% for that quality measure means that 88% of the time, the agency improved their patients\u2019 ability to walk and move around. An end-result outcome is a change in patient health status, such as physiologic, functional, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral health, between two or more time points. Examples of end-result outcome quality measures are Improvement in Management of Oral Medications and Stabilization in Bathing.", "page_num": 279, "metadata": {"chunk_id": 1, "prev_chunk_id": 0, "next_chunk_id": 2}}, {"text": "Examples of end-result outcome quality measures are Improvement in Management of Oral Medications and Stabilization in Bathing.

A utilization outcome is a type of quality measure that reflects use of health care services presumably resulting from a change in the patient\u2019s health status. Examples of utilization outcomes include quality measures that identify hospital admission, use of hospital emergency department services, and discharge to the community. Utilization measures were initially computed using only OASIS data; however, current, and potential future measures may be computed using Medicare FFS claims data.

Outcome measures indicate the change in patient status from one point in time to another point in time. For the OASIS-based quality measures, we use the OASIS items for this calculation. To calculate quality measures, we also need to understand the measure definition for each individual measure. The Quality Measure Tables found on the CMS Home Health Quality Reporting Program website include information on the measure numerator, denominator, and measure exclusions for each home health quality measure (https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment- Instruments/HomeHealthQualityInits).

In this example, this quality measure excludes home health quality episodes for which the patient, at start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, and also excludes quality episodes that end with inpatient facility transfer, death, or a discharge to a non-institutional/home hospice. Therefore, for this quality measure, all patients who at start of care or resumption of care are scored a \u201c0 \u2013 Patient is not short of breath\u201d on OASIS are excluded from this quality measure because the patient cannot improve.

Sample Agency Calculation: If an agency had 100 patients during the reporting period that were discharged from the agency, and 10 of these patients scored \u201c0\u201d at start of care/resumption of care on M1400 (and therefore were excluded) and 70 of the remaining 90 patients improved in dyspnea (moved from a higher numeric score on M1400 to a lower numeric score), then 70/90 (or 0.777) which equals 77.77% scored favorably or improved in dyspnea.", "page_num": 284, "metadata": {"chunk_id": 1, "prev_chunk_id": 0, "next_chunk_id": 2}}, {"text": "Sample Agency Calculation: If an agency had 100 patients during the reporting period that were discharged from the agency, and 10 of these patients scored \u201c0\u201d at start of care/resumption of care on M1400 (and therefore were excluded) and 70 of the remaining 90 patients improved in dyspnea (moved from a higher numeric score on M1400 to a lower numeric score), then 70/90 (or 0.777) which equals 77.77% scored favorably or improved in dyspnea.

RISK ADJUSTMENT OF QUALITY MEASURES Change in health status over a time interval during which care is provided (e.g., a quality episode) can occur either because of the care provided or the natural progression of disease and disability. The challenge in outcome analysis is to attempt to somehow separate changes due to care from those due to natural progression. Statistical risk adjustment refers to a collection of analytic methods designed to separate the relationship of outcomes with care provided from the relationship of outcomes with natural progression of disease and disability, which is critical to accurate outcome analysis.

Risk adjustment compensates or controls for the potential influence of case mix variables (i.e., risk factors) that can affect outcomes. The OASIS-based quality measures are calculated using items from the OASIS assessments from Medicare FFS, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and Medicaid Managed care. For a set of these quality measures a logistic regression prediction model is created. Hundreds of risk factors are tested in the development of prediction models. Risk models are quality measure specific. A rigorous, multi-step process is followed that includes clinical review of the scientifically identified risk factors.
